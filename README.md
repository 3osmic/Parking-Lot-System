# Parking-Lot-System

We will be using a parking lot at Wake Tech to help plan and design our QR code parking system. We have discussed the MOSCOW on what we absolutely will need from this project. The 'must' are set in stone it seems but we still have some flexibility on the rest. Hoping to solidify in our week 3 meeting the specifics on what the parking lot system will do/ won't do. 

As of now the system will be:
- An app to download for anyone visiting Wake Tech campus
- Will be easily scannable via QR code for those in a hurry
- Accessible for those with disabilities
- Will save your car's approximate location to assist in finding your way back to it from anywhere.
